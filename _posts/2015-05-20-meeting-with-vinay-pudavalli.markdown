Today we met with Dr. Vinay Pudavalli.  He holds several positions up at The James, the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University.  Current positions: Professor, Department of Neurological Surgery;Professor, Department of Neurology; Director, Division of Neuro-Oncology.  We had been exploring some clinical trial's and spoke about him to Dr. Curry, Mike's current Nuero-oncologist.  Jena got an appointment to see him and Dr. Curry agreed she should do whatever she could to get in and see him.  The goal of the appointment was to not only explore some clinical trials, but to also get a second opinion.

Dr. Pudavalli started by getting the full history of how we got to this point.  One thing he pointed out was that the heart condition may have been a "red-herring" caused by the neurological issues.  He thinks we definitely need to get our follow up appointments, but said the heart issue could have been a false alarm.  He then went through the images from pre and post surgery.  He agreed/confirmed the surgeon removed all that he could without potentially impacting quality of life (speech / motor skills / etc).  We then were given an education on the types of cells in the brain and what happens to them to get to the point of glioblastoma...we thought he was very thorough and put us at ease with the way he was explaining everything.

He mentioned we need to be sure to speak to Dr. Curry to get MGMT or genetic markers from the biopsy of the tumor.  It can be used to help us understand how a tumor may react to various types of treatments.

He looked at several of the clinical trials that we brought to him.  He explained why most of the clinical trials aren't applicable currently.  He stated the treatment plan the physicians have laid out for Mike is exactly what he would be doing.  This immediately put Jena at ease.  I know she has been receiving information from everyone and to get the second opinion backing it up gave her comfort.  He said after the phase I treatment plan, we should continue to watch for changes in the tumor and at that point we would explore more trials.  He mentioned, as did Mike's current doctors, that the tumor removed could in fact grow back in the same spot.  He said if it regrows or the growth of the remaining tumors would be something we would want to explore alternatives.  We spoke to him about the novocure device, which he knew about.  He confirmed that there was some success with Phase I of the trial for it and we should continue to explore if interested.
