#### Notes from Chemo Oncologist
<ul>
  <li>Pill form
  <ul>
    <li>Temodar</li>
    <li>Temozolide</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mailed to home in approximately 7-10 days</li>
  <li>We discussed a clinical trial being done up at OSU / The James.  Dr. Curry knows the doctor running the trial and called him while we were there.  We are supposed to get a call back by Sunday if Mike qualifies and they have an opening</li>
  <li>We also discussed another trial for <a href="http://www.novocure.com/">Novocure</a>.  He was familiar with this...they actually have a current patient using this device.  We will have to fight for insurance to handle this, but they will help get this done if Mike and Jena decide to try this</li>  
</ul>

#### Notes from Radiation Oncologist
<ul>
  <li>Met with Dr. Elson (Resident) and Dr. Pater</li>
  <li>Radiation passes through the body...no radiation is left and danger to anyone else</li>
  <li>Radiation damages the DNA of cells</li>
  <li>Cancerous cells are too busy dividing to repair the damage the radiation is causing...they die</li>
  <li>Normal cells can repair themselves...but we still try to minimize the normal cells that get raditaion</li>
  <li>Radiation treatments are usually 10-15 minutes.  Each appointment will take approximately 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

####  Miscellaneous Notes
<ul>
  <li>Mike was extremely fatigued today</li>
  <li>Surgical area had more swelling, bruising, and fluid accumulation</li>
  <li>We walked over to Planet Smoothie and got a drink in between appointments...enjoyed the walk together</li>
</ul>
